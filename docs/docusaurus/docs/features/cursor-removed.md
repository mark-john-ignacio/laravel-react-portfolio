# Custom Cursor Removed

## Changes Made

### ✅ 1. Removed from portfolio.tsx

- ❌ Removed `import { CustomCursor } from '@/components/CustomCursor';`
- ❌ Removed `<CustomCursor />` component
- ❌ Removed comment `{/* Custom cursor effect */}`

### ✅ 2. Restored CSS

- ❌ Removed `cursor: none;` from body
- ❌ Removed `cursor: none !important;` from body \*
- ✅ Default cursor is now visible again

## Files Modified

1. `resources/js/pages/portfolio.tsx` - Removed import and component
2. `resources/css/app.css` - Removed cursor hiding CSS

## Result

✅ Your portfolio now uses the **default system cursor**
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ All other features intact (Brittany Chiang design updates preserved)

## Files You Can Delete (Optional)

If you want to clean up completely, you can delete these files:

- `resources/js/components/CustomCursor.tsx`
- `CUSTOM_CURSOR_GUIDE.md`
- `CURSOR_QUICK_REF.md`
- `CURSOR_VISUAL_GUIDE.md`

These are no longer referenced in the code.

**Note**: All the Brittany Chiang design improvements remain intact - only the custom cursor has been removed!
